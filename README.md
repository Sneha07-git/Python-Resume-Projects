# Python Full Fledged Projects
The Portfolio project:
Files = database.csv, requirements.txt, webPy.py
Folders = static, templates

The Car & Pedestrian tracking using Python-AI: 
we are using here HAAR Features & pre-trained XML files to detect a car and pedestrian.
Algorithm:
1. Get a video including cars and pedestrians in it.
2. convert the Video into grayscale for fast implementation (RGB has lots of data)
3. How to train Computer?
  3.1 "Haar-Features" are used to recognize objects in Real-Time
  3.2 We will place these features on the car and pedestrian. 
      the black part will add the all pixels of dark/ shadower part & white will add the white pixels to generate a number.
